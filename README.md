# Fastify-activitypub
This project is a first attempt at building my own single-user ActivityPub instance,
using [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) for HTTP requests.

I'm also using [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.net/) for authentication, and I intend
to store data in human-readable markdown and yaml files, so a static site generator
can be used to build up a public-facing website, as well.

... Wish me luck.
